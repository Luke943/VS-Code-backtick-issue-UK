# VS-Code-backtick-issue-UK-keyboard

Keybinding to toggle between code file and terminal (with terminal staying visible) in VS Code on a UK keyboard.

The standard "ctrl+`" keybinding does not work on a UK keyboard. (Backtick is interpreted as single apostrophe.)

Paste code into the keybindings.json file.
